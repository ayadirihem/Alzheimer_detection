# # Predicting Alzheimer disease using machine learning
# 
# this notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has Alzheimer disease based on their medical attributes
# 
# we're going to take the following approach
# 
#     1. Problem definition
#     2. Data
#     3. Evaluation
#     4. Features
#     5. Modeling
#     4. Building a Predictive System
#     
# ## 1. Problem Definition
# 
# In a statement
# > Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have Alzheimer disease
# 
# ## 2. Data
# 
# the original data come from Alzheimer Features For Analysis on Kaggle
# URL: https://www.kaggle.com/code/hyunseokc/detecting-early-alzheimer-s/notebook?fbclid=IwAR1Uscvx557m0PYmz9C1GXq59nIkCYLQHvtGOR6EaWHT3UaasC3jkJBUJ_k
# 
# ## 3.Evaluation 
# > if we can reach 95% accuracy at prediction whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project
# 
# ## 4.features
# 
# *Create data dictionary *
# 
# > Group --> Class
# * 72 of the subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' throughout the study.
# * 64 of the subjects were grouped as 'Demented' at the time of their initial visits and remained so throughout the study.
# * 14 subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as 'Demented' at a later visit. These fall under the 'Converted' category.
# 
# > Age --> Age
# 
# 
# > EDUC --> Years of Education
# 
# > SES --> Socioeconomic Status / 1-5
# 
# > MMSE --> Mini Mental State Examination : is a widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, ...
# 
# > CDR --> Clinical Dementia Rating
# 
# <img src="Images/CDR.png" />
# 
# > eTIV --> Estimated total intracranial volume
# 
# > nWBV --> Normalize Whole Brain Volume
# 
# > ASF --> Atlas Scaling Factor
